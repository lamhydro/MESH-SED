/**
@mainpage MESH-SED: A sediment transport model for MESH

@section Introduction

A physically-based model to simulate sediment transport in river basins is coupled to the semi-distributed hydrological model MESH. The model is suitable to simulate the transport of solutes in river basin in cold regions. Some characteristics of the model include:
- Loosely coupled with MESH
- Physically-based watershed sediment transport model.
- Developed based on SHETRAN and SHESED.
- Semi-distributed model that work on a orthogonal grid (MESH grid)
- Suitable for large-scale catchment to run on a continuous basis.
- Include different sediment classes.

The following figure shows a flow chart of the model.
